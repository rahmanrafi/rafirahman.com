Include configuration for local rendering of your resume.

Accepted files currently are:

- `resume`: a local copy of your JSON resume, ideally exported for use by `/api/getResume`
- `overrides`: a map of optional overrides to modify how the JSON resume is parsed (applies both to local copies, or fetched from an external API)
